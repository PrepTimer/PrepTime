Contributing to Flutter
=======================

![Build Status](https://github.com/PrepTimer/PrepTime/workflows/build/badge.svg)

Welcome
-------

Thanks for checking out PrepTimer! We are an open-source debate timer built by
debaters, for debaters. Everyone is welcome to contribute code via pull requests,
to file issues on GitHub, to help people asking for help, to help triage, reproduce,
or fix bugs that people have filed, to add to our documentation, or to help out in
any other way.

We will grant commit access (which includes full rights to the issue database, such
as being able to edit labels) to people who have gained our trust and demonstrated
a commitment to PrepTimer and the debate community.

We will communicate primarily over GitHub, and you can tag @justinalexandershaw if
you have any specific questions.

Thanks for reading this,

:heart: Justin
